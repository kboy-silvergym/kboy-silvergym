# Who is kboy?
Real name Kei Fujikawa. Born July 15, 1991 in Sapporo. Known by the nickname "kboy" online. 

After graduating from the School of Creative Science and Engineering at Waseda University in 2015, I gained experience as an App Development Director at Proto Corporation.

Then transitioned to being a programmer, gaining experience in iOS app development for a news app at the news venture, JX Press Corp. 

I later played a significant role as a Lead Engineer at the AR venture, Graffity, releasing the hugely popular app "PechaBato." 

Aiming to enhance individual communication power, I became a freelance engineer in February 2019.

In June 2020, I founded KBOY Inc.

I'm currently working hard to manage "Flutter Daigaku", which is one of the largest Flutter communities in Japan!
